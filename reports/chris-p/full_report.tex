%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}

\usepackage{url}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Exergaming is an activity where users play a virtual game that requires moderate physical exertion. Exergaming systems primarily exist to increase the accessibility of exercise for people lacking the motivation or the means to exercise with conventional methods. Preventing boredom while a system is being used, and creating a motivating force for continued use serve as the main challenges in exergame design.

% We present an exergaming system that utilises spatial exploration as a key gameplay mechanic, in order to benefit from the player's natural desires to explore. Players pilot a pedal-powered helicopter in a virtual world, and are given the task of locating and collecting flags that are distributed throughout the environment. We conduct a user study comparing the normal system with a variant where the location of each flag is displayed to the player at all times. Both the participants' levels of enjoyment, and their willingness to continue exercising were used to evaluate the effectiveness of exploration in our exergame. Results of this user study validate our hypothesis that the exploration mechanic is a valuable tool for increasing motivation in exergames.

% \section{Introduction}
% Regular exercise is fast becoming recognised as one of the largest positive contributors to human health, but many people do not make time to do it. Exergaming is an emerging activity created with the aim of increasing accessibility to exercise, and motivate users who do not usually exercise sufficiently. Exergaming involves playing a game that is controlled through an interface that requires some kind of phyisical exertion.

% While there have been many games in the commercial sector that have had great success such as the wii fit, they often only involve light levels of exercise. Exergaming is yet to provide the revolution of health benefits that many think it could create, a shortcoming that may be linked to a lack of more enjoyable physically intensive exergames.

% For many individuals, moderate intensity exercise can create great discomfort, which acts as a barrier to continued use. In order to enable more intense forms of exergaming to be successful, the methods of motivation used by designers of physically intensive exergames need to be better refined. We believe that research into individual aspects of player motivation will lead to more motivating games that can create lasting positive changes to users' health.

% Competition is one method often used in game design to increase motivation and reduce boredom. In racing games, that serve as a clear crossover between exercise and gaming, competitions' ability to motivate is rarely ignored. Despite a consensis of this game mechanic's benefits, it is used in a variety of ways. Some methods involve indirect competition such as competing against a ghost of the player who currently holds a high score. Others match players against each other in a real time multiplayer environment, where players are actively competing against each other to cross a finish line first.

% These two approaches to competitive play certainly have similarities, however we believe they have different psychological effects on players. We present a psychological experiment regarding competition in exergames. We placing subjects into two groups, one where they believe they are racing a ghost player, and the other where they are told they are competing against an unseen player in real time. Through questioning the subjects we hope to be able to compare and contrast the impacts of these two differing methods of competition on both player motivation and enjoyment.

% We have developed an exergame with the aim of creating a testbed for these experiments in motivation. Players pilot a pedal powered helicopter through a series of hoops that create a race track through a virtual world. The aim of gameplay is to collect all of the flags in as short a time as possible. The users control the accelleration of the helicopter through pedalling on a exercycle, and steer through the use of a joystick.

% Following this introduction, we present an analysis of related work in game motivation and exergames before describing our game's design, and the features that make our experiments possible. We then give a comprehensive explanation of our experiment, along with an analysis of the results gathered. Finally, a reflective discussion of the work described, and of the potential of investigating motivation further with expermiments of this kind.

\section{Related Work}
Competition has been shown to play a key role in motivation. J. Reeve and E. Deci\cite{reeve1996elements} published a study in 1996 that explored the interaction between various aspects of competition and their affect on intrinsic motivation. Their findings suggest that perceived competence positively influences motivation, and that this can be increased by feedback about performance while performing a task. In our work, we wish to give a related commentary on these psychological factors in the context of exergaming. Feedback is given to users of our system through their position in the track relative to the other virtual player. We also aim for our study to review a second embodiment of competition described in the study. The subjects that are told they are racing another player in real time will experience a more direct interpersonal context. Through this perceived increase of social pressure, we can analyse direct competitions' influence on self-determination.

Fitzgerald et al.\cite{fitzgerald2010effects} utilised exergaming as a way to increase intrinsic motivation for participants of physical therapy that need to do exercises with a wobble board. The results of their study showed an increase in interest and enjoyment in subjects using the exergaming system compared to the control group using conventional physical therapy techniques. This is greatly relevant to our work, but does not help towards the design of such exergaming systems. We focus on competition as a specific method for increasing intrinsic motivation, with the aim of leading to the development of exergames that make full use of their motivational potential.

In the short paper by Gobel et al.\cite{gobel2010serious}, a series of exergaming systems were evaluated that all used some degree of personalisation. The results of the paper simply showed feasibility of this particular mechanic however this type of exploratory research into particular aspects of exergame design is similar to our own. Our focus is more specific in nature, and we present our research in the more rigorous form of a controlled user study with the hope of finding reproducible result.


An article on exergames unlocked\footnote{\url{http://exergamesunlocked.org/2013/05/16/cooperation-versus-competition/}} gives an overview of a series of studies comparing competitive exergames to cooperative exergames. Results showed benefits in both techniques, with cooperative play showing larger levels of weight loss over the study period, and the competitive group scoring higher in cognitive assessments. The studies examined do not however analyse which aspects of competitive play are the most motivating, which we believe is important knowledge that could greatly contribute to the design of more motivating exergames.

W. Peng and J. Crouse\cite{peng2011playing} performed a study on the impact of different multiplayer experiences on motivation in exergames. Single player, cooperative multi-player and competitive multi-player were compared through affected enjoyment and motivation for future play. They found inter-personal multi-player games positively influenced motivation, with competitive play leading to greater physical exertion than cooperative play. Our work focuses more directly on competitive play and the psychological affect of direct parallel competition motivation.

There is an increasing amount of research being done into motivation in exergames, however little work has been done into the impact of specific features of game-play on intrinsic motivation. Of those studies that address similar research questions, to our knowledge none have examined the implications of different forms of cooperative play. Competitive exergames have been shown to be successful at increasing motivation for future play, however without research of the kind we present, we are unable to make informed decisions about the design of competitive exergames.
