% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[11 pt, conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Exergaming is an emergent technology focusing on combining exercise and gaming in an attempt to motivate users to participate in a healthier lifestyle. Past research has focused on simulation type gameplay where users avatars participate in activities linked directly to the exercise users perform. Discrepancy between simulations and the real activity can be a source of discomfort and frustration to users. 

	The authors propose an alternate game philosophy where gameplay is detached from real activities that users may have participated in. This allows users to detach from preconceived notions about the activity as well as improving immersion which leads to higher levels of enjoyment and motivation. To evaluate the system the authors conducted a user study which compares two versions of exergaming using an exercycle: one with simulation, and the other with detached gameplay using normal exercycling as a control. Use of detached gameplay saw an increase in both enjoyment and use of the system when compared to the control and simulation variant.

\section{Introduction}
%no \IEEEPARstart

Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and can lead to many health benefits including improving strength and flexibility as well as reducing risks of obesity, heart disease and lower blood pressure \cite{fletcher1996statement, stroth2009aerobic}. Lack of exercise can be harmful and can put subjects at higher risk of obesity , heart disease, higher blood pressure and fatigue\cite{fletcher1996statement}. It is recommended that adults participate in 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise three to six times weekly \cite{fletcher1996statement} in order to gain the benefits and reduce the potential risks. Many find motivation to participate in activities that constitute moderate exercise difficult. This is due to the strenuous nature of the activities involved. 

A solution to increasing motivation is by increasing the enjoyment in participating in the activities. One method of doing this is by combining exercise and video games, exergaming. Past research into exergaming has focused on simulation type gameplay, where users participate in activities which are modelled in the game usually by an avatar. This however can cause discomfort to users due to the discrepancies between the simulations and the real activities. Another source of discomfort comes from negative connotations a user may have with associated activities. With this in mind we propose a new type of gameplay that is detached from the activities that users participate in. 

Another method of increasing enjoyment and participation is the inclusion of a competition element. Competition is an important element in many physical and gaming activities and so is a natural addition to exergaming. We evaluate users perception and response to two different perceived  forms of competition. 

The exergame system we have built puts a user on an exercycle with a joystick controller. The user wears an occulus rift, which is a 3D headset with embedded screens which display the game. The game itself places the user's avatar in a flying craft, power to the flight mechanism is controlled by user's peddling on the cycle while flight controls are mapped to the joystick controller. Gameplay involves navigating the flying craft through a course where the user must fly through a series of gates in order to complete the course. Competition is introduced in the form racing of a ghost. This is another flying craft which also completes the course at the same time as the user. We have three groups of user in order to evaluate their response to different types of competition. The first group is told that the ghost is another user in the next room who they must race through the course. This is a form of direct competition. The second group is told the ghost is a previous high score which they are racing. This is a form of indirect competition. The final group is the control and completes the course without any ghost. 

In this paper we evaluate users response to these different types of competition (direct and indirect) and their effect on motivation to use the system and to exercise. We do this by monitoring user performance as well as getting users to participate in surveys to get feedback on the experience with the system. 


\section{Related Work}


There are many exergaming systems entering the market and the research space. The most notable and widely used systems are Nintendo's wii and Microsoft's xbox kinect. These systems include a controller which is motion sensitive and a 3d camera respectively each with gameplay elements which utilise them. However as noted in \cite{chen2014healthifying} it has been found that this and other consumer systems tend not to promote vigorous activity which promotes health and wellbeing. 


\subsection{Exergaming to promote health and wellbeing}

Exergaming has be shown to be an engaging way to get users to exercise. However with concentration on entertainment rather than health users do not exert enough energy to bring about benefits. For example only 33\% of wii fit activities were shown to make users participate in moderate activity \cite{miyachi2010mets}. It is recommended adults spend 30 minutes 4-6 times weekly participating in moderate exercise \cite{physical2008physical}. Studies by Sell et al and Chen et al have shown that specific forms of exergaming can provide users with enough activity to reach the recommend levels of exercise \cite{sell2008energy, chen2014healthifying}. However it was found that exergames that provided these benefits provided poor continued use, while games with lower activity levels did not \cite{chen2014healthifying}. It is suggested that this is related to the construction of the exergames. Where systems with exercise added to games show better use than games added to exercise \cite{chen2014healthifying}. We developed a system with strong gameplay elements which rely on moderate to strenuous activity that engages users over the long term.  

%Chen - Real study on health benifits of exergames. Also looks into use over time (motivation for uptake)
%Sell - Energy expenditure, health benifits.


\subsection{Motivation and Competition}

Motivation is an important factor when designing exergaming systems to ensure continued use. As moderate exercise for extended periods can be difficult many users find motivation hard. PE Interactive \cite{caldwell2013intersection} is a system designed for use in hospitals to encourage young patients to exercise while there. The system introduces many different elements to provide motivation to users. These include interactive gameplay which are metaphorically linked to real world benefits gained from exercise. This is achieved in out system using areas which are difficult to reach. As the user progresses with their fitness they are able to access these area's giving them a sense of achievement and progress. An intrinsic element of gaming, exercise and exergaming is competition. Competition is a driving factor to adherence and motivation to users \cite{song2010effects}.  Song et al, studied the effects and differences between competition and non competition in exergaming and found users performed a greater amount of activity with the competition element even if they were non-competitive by nature. We extend this study by looking into the effects of competition against a live opponent and against a virtual ghost opponent.

%PHYSC - Self motivation vs external. 
%Song et al - Competition in exergaming
%	Extension/novelty: Looking at the effects of real time competition vs high score (self motivationesce)	

\subsection{Immersion and Gameplay}

The main determining factor in adherence, motivation and use of a system is the gameplay itself.  Fitness computer game \cite{mokka2003fitness} integrated user activity with visual stimuli to create an immersive simulation of cycling through a course. In contrast to this a series of exergames were developed where user activity is completely detached from the gameplay itself \cite{kiili2010developing}. For example a tug of war game where the pulling strength of the avatar is controlled by the user performing squats. Each of these has drawbacks, simulation can often cause frustration when users are familiar with the simulated activity and complete detachment can cause confusion when users cannot perceive links between their activity and gameplay. Speed-based exergaming controllers \cite{park2014human} offer a good balance between the two ideologies. The users activities are still linked to the gameplay in a meaningful way, yet detached enough that users will not experience it as a simulation. We extend the work done with speed-based controllers by adding a secondary controller (a joystick) so that this control method can be used in a virtual three-dimensional space.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
