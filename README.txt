 Contributions
===============

For the record, we would like to state that the number and size of commits did not
always reflect who did what in our project. Almost all of these contributions were 
collaborative to some degree. Also some contributions did not make the final prototype.

Basically we think that we all did approximately equal amounts of work.

Timothy Diack:
==============

- Final helicopter model
- 3 courses (including final terrain layout)
- 4 custom textures
- 1 block asset
- Audio
- Game logic scripting

Jonathan Curtin:
================

- Rings + final ring layout
- Ring triggers
- Sorted out hardware
- Menu: Layout and scripting/control scheme

Christopher Pearce:
===================

- Initial helicopter model
- Flight physics/controls/scripts
- Final terrain + textures

Christopher Morgan:
===================

- Cycle integration 
- Reset function (for when the helicopter flips over)
- Helicopter controls
- Some scenes we scrapped.
